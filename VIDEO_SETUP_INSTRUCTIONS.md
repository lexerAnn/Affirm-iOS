# Character Video Implementation

## Overview
The `CharacterVideoView` replaces the `LightBeingCharacterView` and displays different videos based on affirmation completion status.

## Video Files Required

Add these 3 video files to your Xcode project bundle:

1. **poor.mp4** - Shows when no affirmations are completed (0/3)
2. **medium.mp4** - Shows when some affirmations are completed (1/3 or 2/3) 
3. **good.mp4** - Shows when all affirmations are completed (3/3)

## How to Add Videos to Xcode

1. Drag and drop your video files into your Xcode project
2. Make sure "Add to target" is checked for your main app target
3. The videos should appear in your project navigator
4. The app will automatically detect and play the appropriate video

## Video Specifications

- **Format**: MP4 (recommended), MOV, M4V also supported
- **Resolution**: Any resolution (videos will be scaled to fit)
- **Duration**: Any duration (videos will loop automatically)
- **Size**: Keep file sizes reasonable for app bundle

## Fallback Behavior

If video files are not found, the app will show emoji placeholders:
- ðŸ˜” for "poor" state
- ðŸ˜Š for "medium" state  
- ðŸŽ‰ for "good" state

## Implementation Details

The `CharacterVideoView` class:
- Automatically loops videos
- Handles video state transitions
- Shows placeholders if videos are missing
- Maintains aspect ratio with corner radius
- Supports pause/play controls if needed

## Integration

The video view is already integrated into `StatsViewController` and will automatically update based on:
- `completedAffirmations` vs `totalAffirmations` 
- Progress is calculated as a ratio (0.0 to 1.0)
- Video switches happen instantly when progress changes

## Usage

```swift
// The video view will automatically update when you call:
updateCharacterProgress()

// Or manually set progress:
characterVideoView?.setProgress(0.5) // 50% complete = medium video
```
